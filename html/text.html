        <h2>Workout Tips for Better Results</h2>

    <div class="tips-grid">

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Warm Up Properly</h4>
            <p>
                Spend at least 5–10 minutes warming up before lifting or cardio.
                A good warm-up improves performance and reduces injury risk.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Focus on Form, Not Weight</h4>
            <p>
                Lifting heavier weights with poor form can cause injuries.
                Master proper technique first, then increase weight gradually.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Stay Consistent</h4>
            <p>
                Results come from consistency, not intensity alone.
                Aim for regular workouts rather than extreme sessions.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Balance Strength & Cardio</h4>
            <p>
                Combine strength training and cardio to build muscle,
                burn fat, and improve heart health.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Hydration Matters</h4>
            <p>
                Drink water before, during, and after workouts.
                Dehydration can reduce strength and endurance.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Rest & Recovery</h4>
            <p>
                Muscles grow during rest, not during workouts.
                Sleep well and allow recovery days for better results.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Fuel Your Body Right</h4>
            <p>
                Eat balanced meals with protein, carbs, and healthy fats.
                Nutrition plays a key role in fitness progress.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="tip-card">
            <h4>Track Your Progress</h4>
            <p>
                Track workouts, weights, and measurements.
                Progress tracking keeps you motivated and focused.
